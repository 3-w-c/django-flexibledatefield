django-flexibledate is designed to allow you to enter dates which are not (necessarily) exact.

For example, you can enter a date of 2011, or April 2011. You can also enter a date of April 22, 2011. 
An example usage might be storing the published dates for various publications where no exact date is given.

To use it, simply add "flexibledate" as a django app. Then, you can incorporate it in a model like so:

    from django.db import models
    from flexibledate.fields import FlexibleDateField

    class Publication(models.Model):
        date_published = FlexibleDateField()
        
Flexible date field automatically uses its own widget which allows you to enter the year 
along with (optionally) the month and day.
